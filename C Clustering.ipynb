    "Given a collection of \"objects\" (i.e., instances with attributes), determine similar groups of objects (\"clusters\")\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the following objects with two attributes\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GonzagaCPSC310/U7-Unsupervised-Learning/master/figures/cluster_example1.png\" width=\"450\"/>\n",

    "Q: What are the clusters?\n",
    "* Possibly different ways to cluster, e.g., ...\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GonzagaCPSC310/U7-Unsupervised-Learning/master/figures/cluster_example2.png\" width=\"450\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with $k$-nn, need a distance metric\n",
    "* To determine how close instances so we can form clusters\n",
    "* We'll use Euclidean distance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Centroids\n",
    "A centroid is the point in the center of a cluster. Using Euclidean distances, a cluster's centroid is its \"average point\" ...\n",
    "* Specifically: each attribute value of the centroid is the average of the corresponding attribute value of the points in the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Task 1\n",
    "What is the centroid of the following cluster? Plot it with the points:\n",
    "\n",
    "|att1 |att2|\n",
    "|-|-|\n",
    "|3 |4|\n",
    "|6 |2|\n",
    "|2 |1|\n",
    "|5 |5|\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cluster Quality\n",
    "The quality of the cluster is given by an \"objective function\"\n",
    "* i.e., a function we want to minimize (in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the \"Total Sum of Squares\" (TSS)\n",
    "* The sum of squared distances to the centroid from cluster instances\n",
    "$$TSS = ((x_1 - \\overline{x})^{2} + (y_1 - \\overline{y})^{2}) + ... + ((x_n - \\overline{x})^{2} + (y_n - \\overline{y})^{2})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Task 2\n",
    "Calculate the objective function for the previous example\n",
    "\n",
    "$$TSS = ((3 - 4)^2 + (4 - 3)^2) + ((6 - 4)^2 + (2 - 3)^2) +((2 - 4)^2 + (1 - 3)^2) + ((5 - 4)^2 + (5 - 3)^2) = 20$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes on the TSS:\n",
    "* Can work well here since we use Euclidean distance\n",
    "* Especially if we don't apply the square root function when calculating distances (can just add up the distances used)\n",
    "* TSS also penalizes bigger distances more\n",
    "\n",
    "## $k$-Means clustering algorithm\n",
    "1. Pick a value of $k$\n",
    "1. Select $k$ objects (arbitrarily) to use as initial centroids\n",
    "1. Assign each instance to the cluster of its nearest centroid\n",
    "1. Recalculate the centroids for the $k$ clusters\n",
    "1. Repeat Steps 3-4 until the centroids no longer move (change)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the resulting clusters depend on initial instances used as centroids\n",
    "* e.g., starting with different instances can change the outcome\n",
    "* One approach is to randomly pick $k$ instances as centroids\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What happens when $k$ = 1?\n",
    "* We end up with only one cluster!\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What happens when $k = n$ for $n$ the number of instances?\n",
    "* We end up with 1 cluster per instance (so, the original dataset)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Can find good values for k experimentally ...\n",
    "* In general, we want small values for $k$ (i.e., fewer clusters)\n",
    "* Start with $k$ = 2, then use TSS to measure quality\n",
    "* Move to $k$ = 3, $k$ = 4, and so on, until TSS begins to converge\n",
    "* Select smallest $k$ close to the convergence\n",
    "* See textbook for example\n",
    "\n",
    "Why clustering?\n",
    "* For prediction (e.g., determine instance's cluster, using voting)\n",
    "* For data reduction (reduce dataset to one instance per cluster)\n",
    "* For basic similarity search (e.g., find similar movies)\n",
    "* For data exploration\n",

    "### Lab Task 3\n",
    "This problem uses the T-shirt dataset that is adapted from [this site](https://www.listendata.com/2017/12/k-nearest-neighbor-step-by-step-tutorial.html).\n",

    "1. Let's implement k-means clustering with k=2 using only the height and weight attributes\n",
    "1. Is there a relationship between the clusters formed and T shirt size?\n",
    "1. Let's say there is a new customer named 'Monica' has height 161cm and weight 61kg. What cluster does Monica belong to? Can we conclude anything about her T shirt size?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: because we use the Euclidean distance function, we don't want to forget to normalize the dataset before applying k means clustering!!"
